    "\n",
    "**Ans:** They are advantageous because of the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    " - By using them we can avoid the repetition of codes.\n",
    " - They increases program readability, or we can say our code looks more clean by the virtue of them.\n",
    " - By using functions we can divide a complex problem into simpler and smaller chunks.\n",
    " - Modifying a program becomes easier by using functions.\n",
    " - They reduces chances of error."

    "On the other hand, when it is specified, it only means that code is being readied to be used up in the later stages when required. "

    "### 5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** A variable is only available from inside the space it is created. This is called **scope**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There is only one global scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function. Just right outside the function the variables declared globally will overrule. And thus there will be as many local scopes in a program as there are number of functions in that very program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover,\n",
    "At any given time during execution, we'll have ***at most four active Python scopes***— **local, enclosing, global, and built-in** —depending on where we are in the code. And this summarizes not only the Python scope levels but also the sequence of steps that Python follows when resolving names in a program.\n",
    "This is a **LEGB** rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions.** If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope contains the names that you define in the enclosing function."

    "\n",
    "No, it's not possible to have a return value in the expression because a variabe or another function is a must to extract the value that is returned by the function (always) or we won't get any kind of result or o/p. Now if we want to implement that value returned we can simply use the variable or function that conatins it(or to be more precise, points towards it.)."
